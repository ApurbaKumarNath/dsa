'''
You are in a city with N cities connected by M bi-directional roads. Each road has a danger level, where a higher number means the road is more dangerous.

You start in city 1 and need to go to every other city. The goal is to find the minimum danger level you would face to reach each city from city 1. 
The danger of a path is defined as the highest danger level of any road on that path.

For each city, find the minimum danger level of the path from city 1. If a city is not reachable from city 1, print âˆ’1. 
The danger of reaching city 1 is always 0.
