'''
You are given a directed weighted graph with N nodes and M edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges.
Your task is to find the shortest distance from node 1 to node N, with an additional constraint: the path cannot contain two consecutive 
edges with the same parity (i.e., both even or both odd). If no such path exists, print âˆ’1.
