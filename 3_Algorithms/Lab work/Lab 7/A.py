'''
You are given an directed weighted graph with N nodes and M edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. The graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges.

There is a source and a destination. Your task is to find the shortest distance from the source node to the destination node and print the path taken. 
If multiple shortest paths exist, print any one of them. If no such path exists, print âˆ’1.
